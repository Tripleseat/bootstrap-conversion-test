# Bootstrap Conversion Test 
Can you convert this to Bootstrap?

## The Expectation
Take this lackluster page and convert it to a default Bootstrap layout. This will involve converting all the HTML/CSS to Bootstrap, replacing the modal window with Bootstrap's default Dialog window, and retaining all of the existing javascript functionality. Once you have it completed, zip up your solution and send it to us!

## Tips
* Feel free to remove as much of the existing code as possible
* You will need to add the appropriate CSS and Javascript files
